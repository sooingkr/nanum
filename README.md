## Overview

This project is to build a responsive web application which 1 recommends [HACCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_analysis_and_critical_control_points)-certified food based on the user's concerns and 2 provides a AI-powered chat service for those who want to consult with technical stuff of HACCP.

Several enterprises participate in this project:

* Saltlux
    * Provide the recommendation engine for 1 and AI-powered chat service for 2.
* Korea Agency of HACCP Accreditation & Service (KAHAS)
    * Provide the database for HACCP-certified food.
* Nanum
    * Build a web application.

Lecle has a contract with Nanum and build their webapp including story board, design and development and deliver it to the client. However, we won't maintain the service. Since there are multiple stakholders in this project, our scope of the business may be somewhat ambiguous. Of course, we will try to reduce our scope as much as possible.

For the details, see `index_en.html` of [haccp-doc-en.zip](haccp-doc-en.zip) for English and `index.html` of [haccp-doc-en.zip](haccp-doc-en.zip) for Korean. As for English version, it is translated by Google Translate but its quality is not that good. If you have any question in reading these docs, please ask @donghwan. Note that these documents might get out of date as time goes on, please check out the product backlog that contains the lastest infromation.
